# Follow-up questions
Please either commit your answeers to these questions inline, or submit the answers in an email to the hiring manager.

## 1. How did you find the task?
The task was good and refreshing going through the interview assessment 

## 2. Did you feel you had enough time to complete the task in the way you wanted?
Yes the time was enough to complete task and I was able to develop all the assessment  with respect to the web application  that were requested in the task but could have done much better if had some more time.

## 3. If you had more time, what would you improve / add / do differently?
I would have written some unit test cases ( such as Snapshot testing) using Jest.

## 4. Do you feel that your code is production ready / production quality? If not, what would you do to achieve this?
I feel the code standards are good to be considered as production ready but however it requires some unit test  to be added which suffice the production ready criteria.

## 5. What additional libraries / frameworks / plugins did you use, and why?
I used hooks such as useState(to capture the state changes) and useEffect(to render the details during the loading). This task depends upon external cocktail Db data which might not be reliable as we may or may not receive data, so to handle error and other components not being rendered, also to increase the code readability by avoid handling lifecycle methods, I have preferred to use useEffect.
